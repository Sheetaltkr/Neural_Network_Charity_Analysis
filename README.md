# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Background
Alphabet Soup is a philanthropic foundation dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment, improve people’s well-being and unify the world. The foundation has raised and donated over $10B in the past 20 years to be invested in lifesaving technologies and organizing re-forestation groups around the world. 

Beck’s is a data scientist and programmer who is in charge of data collection and analysis for the entire organization. Her job is to analyze the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients. This helps ensures that the foundations money is being used effectively.
In some cases, the organizations are fraud, hence it is extremely important to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk.

## Purpose:
- Help Beck’s and Alphabet Soup determine which organizations should receive donations.
- Design and train a deep learning neural network model using Python Tensor flow library. This model will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision-making result.
- Create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup using the features in the provided dataset charity_data.csv received from Alphabet Soup’s business team.

##  Results:

### Data Preprocessing
1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
3. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: 
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
